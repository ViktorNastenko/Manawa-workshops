Normally you should already have a personal Jfrog Artifactory and also a service account for your team (see Prerequisites section). 

Now in this section we are going to get the name of your team's repository.

When the first account for your team was opened, a dedicated repo was allowed for your team.

Fist start by login to Jfrog. 

Then search for docker-[your BU]-[your project]-[dev/release] inside "Set Me Up" panel to access your team repository.
